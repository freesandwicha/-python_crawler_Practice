From this practise, i can learn the logic about crawling a website i want. 


(1)Choose the website we want to research. 

Since some web pages are set up with an anti-crawler function, we may need to disguise ourselves as a normal user in this step in order to successfully crawl there.

(2)Parsing the content components of a web page to get the data we want.
Individual pages are different and will have different content to parse. Here, we also use regular expressions to retrieve data.

（3）Save data into Excel and database.
